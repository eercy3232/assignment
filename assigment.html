	<h1>A:microprocessor 2022/23</h1>
	<div class="main">
<p>A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits.microprocessor, any of a type of miniature electronic device that contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to perform the functions of a digital computer’s central processing unit. In effect, this kind of integrated circuit can interpret and execute program< instructions as well as handle arithmetic operations.</p>

<h1>B:vacuum tube</h1>
<p>
A vacuum tube, electron tube, valve (British usage), or tube (North America), is a device that controls electric current flow in a high vacuum between electrodes to which an electric potential difference has been applied. Vacuum tubes aka electron tubes or (thermionic) valves were the workhorse active components in electronics up to the mid-1960s.The mechanical tolerances in vacuum tube manufacturing lead to a slight variation in many tube parameters, e.g. the I/V curves, and the dynamic behavior. Further, tubes exhibit a slight change in performance< in the first hours of operation.
